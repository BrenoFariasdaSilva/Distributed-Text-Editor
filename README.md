# Welcome to TextSync - A Real-Time Distributed-Text-Editor Application!
This is a distributed text editor application, which means that you can edit a text file with your friends, in real time. It is based on the [Operational Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) algorithm, which is used by Google Docs, Etherpad and other collaborative editors.
The purpose of this project is to learn about distributed systems and the challenges of building them.
